For example, all employees can access inventory and pricing software, but only store managers can access payroll and certain accounting software. <br><br> Two fundamental concepts that you need to understand when talking about identity and access are authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ). <br><br> Authentication and authorization both support everything else that happens. They occur sequentially in the identity and access process. <br><br>  Let's take a brief look at each. What is authentication? <br><br> Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service that wants to access a resource. It involves the act of challenging a party for legitimate credentials and provides the basis for creating a security principal for identity and access control. It establishes whether the user is who they say they are. <br><br>  What is authorization? <br><br> Authentication establishes the user's identity, but authorization is the process of establishing what level of access an authenticated person or service has. It specifies what data they're allowed to access and what they can do with it. How are authentication and authorization related? <br><br> Here's a diagram that shows the relationship between authentication and authorization: <br><br> A diagram that shows an identification card and the various kinds of resources the user can access. The identification card represents the user's credentials. <br><br> The identification card represents credentials that the user has to prove their identity (you'll learn more about the types of credentials later in this module.)

          "longDescription": "A workload is a distinct capability or task that's logically separated from other tasks, in terms of business logic and data storage requirements. Each workload defines a set of requirements for availability, scalability, data consistency, and disaster recovery. <br><br>  On Azure, the Special Orders application will require: 1) Two virtual machines. 2) One instance of Azure SQL Database. 3) One instance of Azure Load Balancer  <br><br> The process of combining SLAs helps you compute the composite SLA for a set of services. Computing the composite SLA requires that you multiply the SLA of each individual service. <br><br> For example, to improve the availability of the application, avoid having any single points of failure. So instead of adding more virtual machines, you can deploy one or more extra instances of the same virtual machine across the different availability zones in the same Azure region. <br><br> To ensure high availability, you might plan for your application to have duplicate components across several regions, known as redundancy. Conversely, to minimize costs during non-critical periods, you might run your application only in a single region. Tailwind Traders might consider this if there's a trend that the special order rates are much higher during certain months or seasons. <br><br> To achieve maximum availability in your application, add redundancy to every single part of the application. This redundancy includes the application itself, as well as the underlying services and infrastructure. Be aware, however, that doing so can be difficult and expensive, and often results in solutions that are more complex than they need to be.",
