5. What do you understand by VPC?
VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It allows you to customize your networking configuration. VPC is a network that is logically isolated from other networks in the cloud. It allows you to have your private IP Address range, internet gateways, subnets, and security groups.

6. DNS and Load Balancer Services come under which type of Cloud Service?
DNS and Load Balancer are a part of IaaS-Storage Cloud Service.

7. What are the Storage Classes available in Amazon S3?
Storage Classes available with Amazon S3 are:

Amazon S3 Standard
Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access
Amazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage
Amazon Glacier
8. Explain what T2 instances are?
T2 Instances are designed to provide moderate baseline performance and the capability to burst to higher performance as required by the workload.

9. What are Key-Pairs in AWS?
Key-Pairs are secure login information for your Virtual Machines. To connect to the instances, you can use Key-Pairs which contain a Public Key and a Private Key.

10. How many Subnets can you have per VPC?
You can have 200 Subnets per VPC.

11. List different types of Cloud Services.
Different types of Cloud Services are:

Software as a Service (SaaS)
Data as a Service (DaaS)

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Advanced AWS Questions
12. Explain what S3 is?
S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. You can use the S3 interface to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time and from anywhere on the web. For S3, the payment model is ‚Äúpay as you go‚Äù.

13. How does Amazon Route 53 provide high availability and low latency?
Amazon Route 53 uses the following to provide high availability and low latency:

Globally Distributed Servers - Amazon is a global service and consequently has DNS Servers globally. Any customer creating a query from any part of the world gets to reach a DNS Server local to them that provides low latency.
Dependency - Route 53 provides a high level of dependability required by critical applications.
Optimal Locations - Route 53 serves the requests from the nearest data center to the client sending the request. AWS has data-centers across the world. The data can be cached on different data-centers located in different regions of the world depending on the requirements and the configuration chosen. Route 53 enables any server in any data-center which has the required data to respond. This way, it enables the nearest server to serve the client request, thus reducing the time taken to serve.

Amazon Route
As can be seen in the above image, the requests coming from a user in India are served from the Singapore Server, while the requests coming from a user in the US are routed to Oregon region.

14. How can you send a request to Amazon S3?
Amazon S3 is a REST Service, and you can send a request by using the REST API or the AWS SDK wrapper libraries that wrap the underlying Amazon S3 REST API.

15. What does AMI include?
An AMI includes the following things:

A template for the root volume for the instance.
Launch permissions to decide which AWS accounts can avail the AMI to launch instances.
A block device mapping that determines the volumes to attach to the instance when it is launched.
16. What are the different types of Instances?
Following are the types of instances:

Compute Optimized
Memory-Optimized
Storage Optimized
Accelerated Computing
General Purpose
17. What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?
An AWS Availability Zone is a physical location where an Amazon data center is located. On the other hand, an AWS Region is a collection or group of Availability Zones or Data Centers. 

This setup helps your services to be more available as you can place your VMs in different data centers within an AWS Region. If one of the data centers fails in a Region, the client requests still get served from the other data centers located in the same Region. This arrangement, thus, helps your service to be available even if a Data Center goes down.

18. How do you monitor Amazon VPC?
You can monitor Amazon VPC using:

CloudWatch
VPC Flow Logs
19. What are the different types of EC2 instances based on their costs?
The three types of EC2 instances based on the costs are:

On-Demand Instance - These instances are prepared as and when needed. Whenever you feel the need for a new EC2 instance, you can go ahead and create an on-demand instance. It is cheap for the short-time but not when taken for the long term.

Spot Instance - These types of instances can be bought through the bidding model. These are comparatively cheaper than On-Demand Instances.

Reserved Instance - On AWS, you can create instances that you can reserve for a year or so. These types of instances are especially useful when you know in advance that you will be needing an instance for the long term. In such cases, you can create a reserved instance and save heavily on costs.

20. What do you understand by stopping and terminating an EC2 Instance?
Stopping an EC2 instance means to shut it down as you would normally do on your Personal Computer. This will not delete any volumes attached to the instance and the instance can be started again when needed.

On the other hand, terminating an instance is equivalent to deleting an instance. All the volumes attached to the instance get deleted and it is not possible to restart the instance if needed at a later point in time.

21. What are the consistency models for modern DBs offered by AWS?
Eventual Consistency - It means that the data will be consistent eventually, but may not be immediate. This will serve the client requests faster, but chances are that some of the initial read requests may read the stale data. This type of consistency is preferred in systems where data need not be real-time. For example, if you don‚Äôt see the recent tweets on Twitter or recent posts on Facebook for a couple of seconds, it is acceptable.

Strong Consistency - It provides an immediate consistency where the data will be consistent across all the DB Servers immediately. Accordingly. This model may take some time to make the data consistent and subsequently start serving the requests again. However, in this model, it is guaranteed that all the responses will always have consistent data.

22. What is Geo-Targeting in CloudFront?
Geo-Targeting enables the creation of customized content based on the geographic location of the user. This allows you to serve the content which is more relevant to a user. For example, using Geo-Targeting, you can show the news related to local body elections to a user sitting in India, which you may not want to show to a user sitting in the US. Similarly, the news related to Baseball Tournament can be more relevant to a user sitting in the US, and not so relevant for a user sitting in India.

23. What are the advantages of AWS IAM?
AWS IAM enables an administrator to provide granular level access to different users and groups. Different users and user groups may need different levels of access to different resources created. With IAM, you can create roles with specific access-levels and assign the roles to the users. 

It also allows you to provide access to the resources to users and applications without creating the IAM Roles, which is known as Federated Access.

24. What do you understand by a Security Group?
When you create an instance in AWS, you may or may not want that instance to be accessible from the public network. Moreover, you may want that instance to be accessible from some networks and not from others.

Security Groups are a type of rule-based Virtual Firewall using which you can control access to your instances. You can create rules defining the Port Numbers, Networks, or protocols from which you want to allow access or deny access.

25. What are Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances?
When AWS creates EC2 instances, there are some blocks of computing capacity and processing power left unused. AWS releases these blocks as Spot Instances. Spot Instances run whenever capacity is available. These are a good option if you are flexible about when your applications can run and if your applications can be interrupted.

On the other hand, On-Demand Instances can be created as and when needed. The prices of such instances are static. Such instances will always be available unless you explicitly terminate them.

26. Explain Connection Draining.
Connection Draining is a feature provided by AWS which enables your servers which are either going to be updated or removed, to serve the current requests. 

If Connection Draining is enabled, the Load Balancer will allow an outgoing instance to complete the current requests for a specific period but will not send any new request to it. Without Connection Draining, an outgoing instance will immediately go off and the requests pending on that instance will error out.

27. What is a Stateful and a Stateless Firewall?
A Stateful Firewall is the one that maintains the state of the rules defined. It requires you to define only inbound rules. Based on the inbound rules defined, it automatically allows the outbound traffic to flow. 

On the other hand, a Stateless Firewall requires you to explicitly define rules for inbound as well as outbound traffic. 

For example, if you allow inbound traffic from Port 80, a Stateful Firewall will allow outbound traffic to Port 80, but a Stateless Firewall will not do so.

28. What is a Power User Access in AWS?
An Administrator User will be similar to the owner of the AWS Resources. He can create, delete, modify or view the resources and also grant permissions to other users for the AWS Resources.

A Power User Access provides Administrator Access without the capability to manage the users and permissions. In other words, a user with Power User Access can create, delete, modify or see the resources, but he cannot grant permissions to other users.

29. What is an Instance Store Volume and an EBS Volume?
An Instance Store Volume is temporary storage that is used to store the temporary data required by an instance to function. The data is available as long as the instance is running. As soon as the instance is turned off, the Instance Store Volume gets removed and the data gets deleted.

On the other hand, an EBS Volume represents a persistent storage disk. The data stored in an EBS Volume will be available even after the instance is turned off.

30. What are Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective in AWS?
Recovery Time Objective - It is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This translates to an acceptable time window when the service can be unavailable.

Recover Point Objective - It is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data restore point. It translates to the acceptable amount of data loss which lies between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.

31. Is there a way to upload a file that is greater than 100 Megabytes in Amazon S3?
Yes, it is possible by using the Multipart Upload Utility from AWS. With the Multipart Upload Utility, larger files can be uploaded in multiple parts that are uploaded independently. You can also decrease upload time by uploading these parts in parallel. After the upload is done, the parts are merged into a single object or file to create the original file from which the parts were created.

32. Can you change the Private IP Address of an EC2 instance while it is running or in a stopped state?
No, a Private IP Address of an EC2 instance cannot be changed. When an EC2 instance is launched, a private IP Address is assigned to that instance at the boot time. This private IP Address is attached to the instance for its entire lifetime and can never be changed.

33. What is the use of lifecycle hooks is Autoscaling?
Lifecycle hooks are used for Auto-scaling to put an additional wait time to a scale-in or a scale-out event.

34. What are the policies that you can set for your user‚Äôs passwords?
Following are the policies that can be set for user‚Äôs passwords:

You can set a minimum length of the password.
You can ask the users to add at least one number or special character to the password.
Assigning the requirements of particular character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
You can enforce automatic password expiration, prevent the reuse of old passwords, and request for a password reset upon their next AWS sign-in.
You can have the AWS users contact an account administrator when the user has allowed the password to expire.

You can know that you are paying the correct amount for the resources that you are using by employing the following resources:

Check the Top Services Table
It is a dashboard in the cost management console that shows you the top five most used services. This will let you know how much money you are spending on the resources in question.
Cost Explorer
There are cost explorer services available that will help you to view and analyze your usage costs for the last 13 months. You can also get a cost forecast for the upcoming three months.
AWS Budgets
This allows you to plan a budget for the services. Also, it will enable you to check if the current plan meets your budget and the details of how you use the services.
Cost Allocation Tags
This helps in identifying the resource that has cost more in a particular month. It lets you organize your resources and cost allocation tags to keep track of your AWS costs.

10. What are the native AWS Security logging capabilities?
Most of the AWS services have their logging options. Also, some of them have an account level logging, like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others. Let‚Äôs take a look at two services in specific:

AWS CloudTrail
This is a service that provides a history of the AWS API calls for every account. It lets you perform security analysis, resource change tracking, and compliance auditing of your AWS environment as well. The best part about this service is that it enables you to configure it to send notifications via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered.

AWS Config 
This helps you understand the configuration changes that happen in your environment. This service provides an AWS inventory that includes configuration history, configuration change notification, and relationships between AWS resources. It can also be configured to send information via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered.

11. What is a DDoS attack, and what services can minimize them?
DDoS is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator accesses a website and creates multiple sessions so that the other legitimate users cannot access the service. The native tools that can help you deny the DDoS attacks on your AWS services are:

ELB
VPC
DDOS attack

12. You are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?
Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. When Amazon initially launches a new service, it doesn‚Äôt get immediately published in all the regions. They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. So, if you don‚Äôt see a specific service in your region, chances are the service hasn‚Äôt been published in your region yet. However, if you want to get the service that is not available, you can switch to the nearest region that provides the services.

13. How do you set up a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?
Amazon CloudWatch helps you to monitor the application status of various AWS services and custom events. It helps you to monitor:

State changes in Amazon EC2
Auto-scaling lifecycle events
Scheduled events
AWS API calls
Console sign-in events
amazon cloud watch

14. What are the different types of virtualization in AWS, and what are the differences between them?
The three major types of virtualization in AWS are: 

Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM)
It is a fully virtualized hardware, where all the virtual machines act separate from each other. These virtual machines boot by executing a master boot record in the root block device of your image.
Paravirtualization (PV)
Paravirtualization-GRUB is the bootloader that boots the PV AMIs. The PV-GRUB chain loads the kernel specified in the menu.
Paravirtualization on HVM
PV on HVM helps operating systems take advantage of storage and network I/O available through the host.
15. Name some of the AWS services that are not region-specific
AWS services that are not region-specific are:

IAM
Route 53
Web Application Firewall 
CloudFront
16. What are the differences between NAT Gateways and NAT Instances?

18. What is an Elastic Transcoder?
To support multiple devices with various resolutions like laptops, tablets, and smartphones, we need to change the resolution and format of the video. This can be done easily by an AWS Service tool called the Elastic Transcoder, which is a media transcoding in the cloud that exactly lets us do the needful. It is easy to use, cost-effective, and highly scalable for businesses and developers.

AWS Questions for Amazon EC2
19. What is Amazon EC2?
EC2 is short for Elastic Compute Cloud, and it provides scalable computing capacity. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware, leading to faster development and deployment of applications. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. It can scale up or down to handle changes in requirements, reducing the need to forecast traffic. EC2 provides virtual computing environments called ‚Äúinstances.‚Äù

20. What Are Some of the Security Best Practices for Amazon EC2?
Security best practices for Amazon EC2 include using Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to AWS resources; restricting access by only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on an instance; only opening up those permissions you require, and disabling password-based logins for instances launched from your AMI.

21. Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?
Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices backed by local instance storage. That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment, developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services that make up AWS.

22. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance? 
While you may think that both stopping and terminating are the same, there is a difference. When you stop an EC2 instance, it performs a normal shutdown on the instance and moves to a stopped state. However, when you terminate the instance, it is transferred to a stopped state, and the EBS volumes attached to it are deleted and can never be recovered. 

23. What are the different types of EC2 instances based on their costs?
The three types of EC2 instances are:

On-demand Instance
It is cheap for a short time but not when taken for the long term
Spot Instance
It is less expensive than the on-demand instance and can be bought through bidding. 
Reserved Instance
If you are planning to use an instance for a year or more, then this is the right one for you.
24. How do you set up SSH agent forwarding so that you do not have to copy the key every time you log in?
Here‚Äôs how you accomplish this:

Go to your PuTTY Configuration
Go to the category SSH -> Auth
Enable SSH agent forwarding to your instance
Putty configuration

25. What are Solaris and AIX operating systems? Are they available with AWS?
Solaris is an operating system that uses SPARC processor architecture, which is not supported by the public cloud currently. 

AIX is an operating system that runs only on Power CPU and not on Intel, which means that you cannot create AIX instances in EC2.

Since both the operating systems have their limitations, they are not currently available with AWS.

26. How do you configure CloudWatch to recover an EC2 instance?
Here‚Äôs how you can configure them:

Create an Alarm using Amazon CloudWatch
In the Alarm, go to Define Alarm -> Actions tab
Choose Recover this instance option
create alarm

27. What are the common types of AMI designs?
There are many types of AMIs, but some of the common AMIs are:

Fully Baked AMI
Just Enough Baked AMI (JeOS AMI)
Hybrid AMI
28. What are Key-Pairs in AWS?
The Key-Pairs are password-protected login credentials for the Virtual Machines that are used to prove our identity while connecting the Amazon EC2 instances. The Key-Pairs are made up of a Private Key and a Public Key which lets us connect to the instances.

AWS Interview Questions for S3
29. What is Amazon S3? 
S3 is short for Simple Storage Service, and Amazon S3 is the most supported storage platform available. S3 is object storage that can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Despite that versatility, it is practically unlimited as well as cost-effective because it is storage available on demand. In addition to these benefits, it offers unprecedented levels of durability and availability. Amazon S3 helps to manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance. 

30. How can you recover/login to an EC2 instance for which you have lost the key?
Follow the steps provided below to recover an EC2 instance if you have lost the key:

Verify that the EC2Config service is running
Detach the root volume for the instance
Attach the volume to a temporary instance
Modify the configuration file
Restart the original instance

AWS Interview Questions for VPC
36. What Is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Why Is It Used?
A VPC is the best way of connecting to your cloud resources from your own data center. Once you connect your datacenter to the VPC in which your instances are present, each instance is assigned a private IP address that can be accessed from your data center. That way, you can access your public cloud resources as if they were on your own private network.

37. VPC is not resolving the server through DNS. What might be the issue, and how can you fix it?
To fix this problem, you need to enable the DNS hostname resolution, so that the problem resolves itself.

38. How do you connect multiple sites to a VPC?
If you have multiple VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. Here‚Äôs a diagram that will show you how to connect various sites to a VPC:

42. When Would You Prefer Provisioned IOPS over Standard Rds Storage?
You would use Provisioned IOPS when you have batch-oriented workloads. Provisioned IOPS delivers high IO rates, but it is also expensive. However, batch processing workloads do not require manual intervention. 

43. How Do Amazon Rds, Dynamodb, and Redshift Differ from Each Other?
Amazon RDS is a database management service for relational databases. It manages patching, upgrading, and data backups automatically. It‚Äôs a database management service for structured data only. On the other hand, DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service for dealing with unstructured data. Redshift is a data warehouse product used in data analysis.

44. What Are the Benefits of AWS‚Äôs Disaster Recovery?
Businesses use cloud computing in part to enable faster disaster recovery of critical IT systems without the cost of a second physical site. The AWS cloud supports many popular disaster recovery architectures ranging from small customer workload data center failures to environments that enable rapid failover at scale. With data centers all over the world, AWS provides a set of cloud-based disaster recovery services that enable rapid recovery of your IT infrastructure and data.

45. How can you add an existing instance to a new Auto Scaling group?
Here‚Äôs how you can add an existing instance to a new Auto Scaling group:

Open EC2 console
Select your instance under Instances
Choose Actions -> Instance Settings -> Attach to Auto Scaling Group
Select a new Auto Scaling group
Attach this group to the Instance
Edit the Instance if needed
Once done, you can successfully add the instance to a new Auto Scaling group
46. What are the factors to consider while migrating to Amazon Web Services?

47. What is RTO and RPO in AWS?
RTO or Recovery Time Objective is the maximum time your business or organization is willing to wait for a recovery to complete in the wake of an outage. On the other hand, RPO or Recovery Point Objective is the maximum amount of data loss your company is willing to accept as measured in time.

48. If you would like to transfer vast amounts of data, which is the best option among Snowball, Snowball Edge, and Snowmobile?
AWS Snowball is basically a data transport solution for moving high volumes of data into and out of a specified AWS region. On the other hand, AWS Snowball Edge adds additional computing functions apart from providing a data transport solution. The snowmobile is an exabyte-scale migration service that allows you to transfer data up to 100 PB.

49. Explain what T2 instances are?
The T2 Instances are intended to give the ability to burst to a higher performance whenever the workload demands it and also provide a moderate baseline performance to the CPU.

The T2 instances are General Purpose instance types and are low in cost as well. They are usually used wherever workloads do not consistently or often use the CPU. 

50. What are the advantages of AWS IAM?
AWS IAM allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access. Various user groups and users may require varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed. We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM.

It further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM Roles.

51. Explain Connection Draining
Connection Draining is an AWS service that allows us to serve current requests on the servers that are either being decommissioned or updated.

By enabling this Connection Draining, we let the Load Balancer make an outgoing instance finish its existing requests for a set length of time before sending it any new requests. A departing instance will immediately go off if Connection Draining is not enabled, and all pending requests will fail.

52. What is Power User Access in AWS?
The AWS Resources owner is identical to an Administrator User. The Administrator User can build, change, delete, and inspect resources, as well as grant permissions to other AWS users.

Administrator Access without the ability to control users and permissions is provided to a Power User. A Power User Access user cannot provide permissions to other users but has the ability to modify, remove, view, and create resources.
AWS Questions for CloudFormation
53. How is AWS CloudFormation different from AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
Here are some differences between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

AWS CloudFormation helps you provision and describe all of the infrastructure resources that are present in your cloud environment. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.
AWS CloudFormation supports the infrastructure needs of various types of applications, like legacy applications and existing enterprise applications. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is combined with the developer tools to help you manage the lifecycle of your applications.
54. What are the elements of an AWS CloudFormation template?
AWS CloudFormation templates are YAML or JSON formatted text files that are comprised of five essential elements, they are:

Template parameters
Output values
Data tables
Resources
File format version
55. What happens when one of the resources in a stack cannot be created successfully?
If the resource in the stack cannot be created, then the CloudFormation automatically rolls back and terminates all the resources that were created in the CloudFormation template. This is a handy feature when you accidentally exceed your limit of Elastic IP addresses or don‚Äôt have access to an EC2 AMI.

AWS Questions for Elastic Block Storage
56. How can you automate EC2 backup using EBS?
Use the following steps in order to automate EC2 backup using EBS:

Get the list of instances and connect to AWS through API to list the Amazon EBS volumes that are attached locally to the instance.
List the snapshots of each volume, and assign a retention period of the snapshot. Later on, create a snapshot of each volume.
Make sure to remove the snapshot if it is older than the retention period.
57. What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?
EBS is a kind of permanent storage in which the data can be restored at a later point. When you save data in the EBS, it stays even after the lifetime of the EC2 instance. On the other hand, Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to a host machine. With an Instance Store, you cannot detach one instance and attach it to another. Unlike in EBS, data in an Instance Store is lost if any instance is stopped or terminated.

58. Can you take a backup of EFS like EBS, and if yes, how?
Yes, you can use the EFS-to-EFS backup solution to recover from unintended changes or deletion in Amazon EFS. Follow these steps:

Sign in to the AWS Management Console
Click the launch EFS-to-EFS-restore button
Use the region selector in the console navigation bar to select region
Verify if you have chosen the right template on the Select Template page
Assign a name to your solution stack
Review the parameters for the template and modify them if necessary
59. How do you auto-delete old snapshots?
Here‚Äôs the procedure for auto-deleting old snapshots:

As per procedure and best practices, take snapshots of the EBS volumes on Amazon S3.
Use AWS Ops Automator to handle all the snapshots automatically.
This allows you to create, copy, and delete Amazon EBS snapshots.

Classic Load Balancer
Used if your application is built within the EC2 Classic network

AWS Interview Questions for Security
62. What Is Identity and Access Management (IAM) and How Is It Used?
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. IAM lets you manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.

63. How can you use AWS WAF in monitoring your AWS applications?
AWS WAF or AWS Web Application Firewall protects your web applications from web exploitations. It helps you control the traffic flow to your applications. With WAF, you can also create custom rules that block common attack patterns. It can be used for three cases: allow all requests, prevent all requests, and count all requests for a new policy.

64. What are the different AWS IAM categories that you can control?
Using AWS IAM, you can do the following:

Create and manage IAM users
Create and manage IAM groups
Manage the security credentials of the users
Create and manage policies to grant access to AWS services and resources
65. What are the policies that you can set for your users‚Äô passwords?
Here are some of the policies that you can set:

You can set a minimum length of the password, or you can ask the users to add at least one number or special characters in it.
You can assign requirements of particular character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.
You can enforce automatic password expiration, prevent reuse of old passwords, and request for a password reset upon their next AWS sign in.
You can have the AWS users contact an account administrator when the user has allowed the password to expire. 
66. What is the difference between an IAM role and an IAM user?
The two key differences between the IAM role and IAM user are:

An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests, while an IAM user has permanent long-term credentials and is used to interact with the AWS services directly.  
In the IAM role, trusted entities, like IAM users, applications, or an AWS service, assume roles whereas the IAM user has full access to all the AWS IAM functionalities.
67. What are the managed policies in AWS IAM?
There are two types of managed policies; one that is managed by you and one that is managed by AWS. They are IAM resources that express permissions using IAM policy language. You can create, edit, and manage them separately from the IAM users, groups, and roles to which they are attached.

68. Can you give an example of an IAM policy and a policy summary?
Here‚Äôs an example of an IAM policy to grant access to add, update, and delete objects from a specific folder.

IAM policy

Here‚Äôs an example of a policy summary:

policy summary

69. How does AWS IAM help your business?
IAM enables to:

Manage IAM users and their access - AWS IAM provides secure resource access to multiple users
Manage access for federated users ‚Äì AWS allows you to provide secure access to resources in your AWS account to your employees and applications without creating IAM roles
AWS Interview Questions for Route 53
70. What Is Amazon Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS). The name refers to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.

71. What Is Cloudtrail and How Do Cloudtrail and Route 53 Work Together? 
CloudTrail is a service that captures information about every request sent to the Amazon Route 53 API by an AWS account, including requests that are sent by IAM users. CloudTrail saves log files of these requests to an Amazon S3 bucket. CloudTrail captures information about all requests. You can use information in the CloudTrail log files to determine which requests were sent to Amazon Route 53, the IP address that the request was sent from, who sent the request, when it was sent, and more.

72. What is the difference between Latency Based Routing and Geo DNS?
The Geo Based DNS routing takes decisions based on the geographic location of the request. Whereas, the Latency Based Routing utilizes latency measurements between networks and AWS data centers. Latency Based Routing is used when you want to give your customers the lowest latency possible. On the other hand, Geo Based routing is used when you want to direct the customer to different websites based on the country or region they are browsing from. 

73. What is the difference between a Domain and a Hosted Zone?
Domain
A domain is a collection of data describing a self-contained administrative and technical unit. For example, www.simplilearn.com is a domain and a general DNS concept.

Hosted zone
A hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain. For example, lms.simplilearn.com is a hosted zone.

74. How does Amazon Route 53 provide high availability and low latency?
Here‚Äôs how Amazon Route 53 provides the resources in question:

Globally Distributed Servers
Amazon is a global service and consequently has DNS services globally. Any customer creating a query from any part of the world gets to reach a DNS server local to them that provides low latency. 

Dependency
Route 53 provides a high level of dependability required by critical applications

Optimal Locations
Route 53 uses a global anycast network to answer queries from the optimal position automatically. 

AWS Interview Questions for Config
75. How does AWS config work with AWS CloudTrail?
AWS CloudTrail records user API activity on your account and allows you to access information about the activity. Using CloudTrail, you can get full details about API actions such as the identity of the caller, time of the call, request parameters, and response elements. On the other hand, AWS Config records point-in-time configuration details for your AWS resources as Configuration Items (CIs). 

You can use a CI to ascertain what your AWS resource looks like at any given point in time. Whereas, by using CloudTrail, you can quickly answer who made an API call to modify the resource. You can also use Cloud Trail to detect if a security group was incorrectly configured.

76. Can AWS Config aggregate data across different AWS accounts?
Yes, you can set up AWS Config to deliver configuration updates from different accounts to one S3 bucket, once the appropriate IAM policies are applied to the S3 bucket.

AWS Interview Questions for Database
77. How are reserved instances different from on-demand DB instances?
Reserved instances and on-demand instances are the same when it comes to function. They only differ in how they are billed.

Reserved instances are purchased as one-year or three-year reservations, and in return, you get very low hourly based pricing when compared to the on-demand cases that are billed on an hourly basis.

78. Which type of scaling would you recommend for RDS and why?
There are two types of scaling - vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling lets you vertically scale up your master database with the press of a button. A database can only be scaled vertically, and there are 18 different instances in which you can resize the RDS. On the other hand, horizontal scaling is good for replicas. These are read-only replicas that can only be done through Amazon Aurora.

79. What is a maintenance window in Amazon RDS? Will your DB instance be available during maintenance events?
RDS maintenance window lets you decide when DB instance modifications, database engine version upgrades, and software patching have to occur. The automatic scheduling is done only for patches that are related to security and durability. By default, there is a 30-minute value assigned as the maintenance window and the DB instance will still be available during these events though you might observe a minimal effect on performance.

80. What are the consistency models in DynamoDB?
There are two consistency models In DynamoDB. First, there is the Eventual Consistency Model, which maximizes your read throughput. However, it might not reflect the results of a recently completed write. Fortunately, all the copies of data usually reach consistency within a second. The second model is called the Strong Consistency Model. This model has a delay in writing the data, but it guarantees that you will always see the updated data every time you read it. 

81. What type of query functionality does DynamoDB support?
DynamoDB supports GET/PUT operations by using a user-defined primary key. It provides flexible querying by letting you query on non-primary vital attributes using global secondary indexes and local secondary indexes.

1) What is AWS?
AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It is a service which is provided by the Amazon that uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT resources on demand. It provides different services such as an infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service.

2) What are the components of AWS?
The following are the main components of AWS are:

Simple Storage Service: S3 is a service of aws that stores the files. It is object-based storage, i.e., you can store the images, word files, pdf files, etc. The size of the file that can be stored in S3 is from 0 Bytes to 5 TB. It is an unlimited storage medium, i.e., you can store the data as much you want. S3 contains a bucket which stores the files. A bucket is like a folder that stores the files. It is a universal namespace, i.e., name must be unique globally. Each bucket must have a unique name to generate the unique DNS address.
Elastic Compute Cloud: Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can scale the compute capacity up and down as per the computing requirement changes. It changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for the resources that you actually use.
Elastic Block Store: It provides a persistent block storage volume for use with EC2 instances in aws cloud. EBS volume is automatically replicated within its availability zone to prevent the component failure. It offers high durability, availability, and low-latency performance required to run your workloads.
CloudWatch: It is a service which is used to monitor all the AWS resources and applications that you run in real time. It collects and tracks the metrics that measure your resources and applications. If you want to know about the CloudWatch in detail, then click on the below link: Click here

5) What are the pricing models for EC2 instances?
There are four pricing models for EC2 instances:

On-Demand instance
On-Demand pricing is also known as pay-as-you-go. Pay-as-you-go is a pricing model that allows you to pay only for those resources that you use.
You need to pay for the compute capacity by per hour or per second that depends on which instances you run.
On-Demand instance does not require any upfront payments.
While using On-Demand instance, you can increase or decrease the compute capacity based on the requirements of your application.
On-Demand instances are recommended for those applications which are of short term and unpredictable workloads.
Users that want low cost and flexibility on EC2 instances with no upfront payments.
On-Demand instances are used for those applications which have been developed or tested on EC2 for the first time.
Reserved instance
Reserved instance is the second most important pricing model that reduces the overall cost of your AWS environment by making an upfront payment for those services that you know will be used in the future.
Reserved instances provide a discount of up to 75% as compared to On-Demand instance.
Reserved instances are assigned to a specific Availability zone that reserves the compute capacity for you so that you can use whenever you need.
Reserved instances are mainly recommended for those applications that have steady state and require reserve capacity.
Customers who want to use the EC2 over 1 to 3 term can use the reserved instance to reduce the overall computing costs.
Spot instance
Spot instances consist of unused capacity which is available at a highly discounted rate.
It offers up to 90% discount as compared to On-Demand instance.
Spot instances are mainly recommended for those applications which have flexible start and end times.
It is useful when applications require computing capacity at a very low price.
It is useful when applications require additional amount of computing capacity at an urgent need.
Dedicated Hosts
It is a physical EC2 server which is dedicated for your use. It reduces the overall costs by providing you a VPC that comprise of a dedicated hardware.
6) What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code without managing servers. Lambda function runs your code whenever needed. You need to pay only when your code is running. If you want to know more about the AWS Lambda, then click on the link shown below:

17) What is an EIP?
EIP (Elastic IP address) is a service provided by an EC2 instance. It is basically a static IP address attached to an EC2 instance. This address is associated with your AWS account not with an EC2 instance. You can also disassociate your EIP address from your EC2 instance and map it to another EC2 instance in your AWS account.

Let's understand the concept of EIP through an example:

AWS Interview Questions
Suppose we consider the website www.javatpoint.com
points to the instance which has a public IP address. When instance is restarted, then AWS takes another public IP address from the pool and the previous public IP address is no longer valid. Due to this reason, the original link is no longer available between the website and EC2 instance. To overcome from such situation, Elastic IP address or static address is used which does not change.

18) What are the different storage classes in S3?
Storage classes are used to assist the concurrent loss of data in one or two facilities. Each object in S3 is associated with some storage class. Amazon S3 contains some storage classes in which you can store your objects. You can choose a storage class based on your requirements and these storage classes offer high durability. To know more about the storage classes and its types, click on the link given below:

19) How can you secure the access to your S3 bucket?
S3 bucket can be secured in two ways:

ACL (Access Control List)
ACL is used to manage the access of resources to buckets and objects. An object of each bucket is associated with ACL. It defines which AWS accounts have granted access and the type of access. When a user sends the request for a resource, then its corresponding ACL will be checked to verify whether the user has granted access to the resource or not.
When you create a bucket, then Amazon S3 creates a default ACL which provides a full control over the AWS resources.
Bucket Policies
Bucket policies are only applied to S3 bucket. Bucket policies define what actions are allowed or denied. Bucket policies are attached to the bucket not to an S3 object but the permissions define in the bucket policy are applied to all the objects in S3 bucket.
The following are the main elements of Bucket policy:

Sid
A Sid determines what the policy will do. For example, if an action that needs to be performed is adding a new user to an Access Control List (ACL), then the Sid would be AddCannedAcl. If the policy is defined to evaluate IP addresses, then the Sid would be IPAllow.
Effect: An effect defines an action after applying the policy. The action could be either to allow an action or to deny an action.
Principal
A Principal is a string that determines to whom the policy is applied. If we set the principal string as '*', then the policy is applied to everyone, but it is also possible that you can specify individual AWS account.
Action
An Action is what happens when the policy is applied. For example, s3:Getobject is an action that allows to read object data.
Resource
The Resource is a S3 bucket to which the statement is applied. You cannot enter a simply bucket name, you need to specify the bucket name in a specific format. For example, the bucket name is javatpoint-bucket, then the resource would be written as "arn:aws:s3""javatpoint-bucket/*".
20) What are policies and what are the different types of policies?
Policy is an object which is associated with a resource that defines the permissions. AWS evaluate these policies when user makes a request. Permissions in the policy determine whether to allow or to deny an action. Policies are stored in the form of a JSON documents.

AWS supports six types of policies:

Identity-based policies
Resource-based policies
Permissions boundaries
Organizations SCPs
Access Control Lists
Session policies
AWS Interview Questions
Identity-based policies
Identity-based policies are the permissions stored in the form of JSON format. This policy can be attached to an identity user, group of users or role. It determines the actions that the users can perform, on which resources, and under what conditions.
Identity-based policies are further classified into two categories:
Managed Policies: Managed Policies are the identity-based policies which can be attached to multiple users, groups or roles. There are two types of managed policies:
AWS Managed Policies
AWS Managed Policies are the policies created and managed by AWS. If you are using the policies first time, then we recommend you to use AWS Managed Policies.
Custom Managed Policies
Custom Managed Policies are the identity-based policies created by user. It provides more precise control over the policies than AWS Managed Policies.
Inline Policies
Inline Policies are the policies created and managed by user. These policies are encapsulated directly into a single user, group or a role.
Resource-Based Policies
Resource-based policies are the policies which are attached to the resource such as S3 bucket. Resource-based policies define the actions that can be performed on the resource and under what condition, these policies can be applied.
Permissions boundaries
Permissions boundaries are the maximum permissions that identity-based policy can grant to the entity.
Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Service Control Policies are the policies defined in a JSON format that specify the maximum permissions for an organization. If you enable all the features in an Organization, then you can apply Service Control Policies to any or all of your AWS accounts. SCP can limit the permission on entities in member accounts as well as AWS root user account.
Access Control Lists (ACLs)
ACL defines the control that which principals in another AWS account can access the resource. ACLs cannot be used to control the access of a principal in a different AWS account. It is the only policy type which does not have the JSON policy document format.
21) What are different types of instances?
Following are the different types of instances:


General Purpose Instance type
General purpose instances are the instances mainly used by the companies. There are two types of General Purpose instances: Fixed performance (eg. M3 and M4) and Burstable performance (eg. T2). Some of the sectors use this instance such as Development environments, build servers, code repositories, low traffic websites and web applications, micro-services, etc.

Following are the General Purpose Instances:
T2 instances: T2 instances are the instances that receive CPU credits when they are sitting idle and they use the CPU credits when they are active. These instances do not use the CPU very consistently, but it has the ability to burst to a higher level when required by the workload.
M4 instances: M4 instances are the latest version of General purpose instances. These instances are the best choice for managing memory and network resources. They are mainly used for the applications where demand for the micro-servers is high.
M3 instances: M3 instance is a prior version of M4. M4 instance is mainly used for data processing tasks which require additional memory, caching fleets, running backend servers for SAP and other enterprise applications.
Compute Optimized Instance type
Compute Optimized Instance type consists of two instance types: C4 and C3.
C3 instance: C3 instances are mainly used for those applications which require very high CPU usage. These instances are mainly recommended for those applications that require high computing power as these instances offer high performing processors.
C4 instance: C4 instance is the next version of C3 instance. C4 instance is mainly used for those applications that require high computing power. It consists of Intel E5-2666 v3 processor and use Hardware virtualization. According to the AWS specifications, C4 instances can run at a speed of 2.9 GHz, and can reach to a clock speed of 3.5 GHz.
GPU Instances
GPU instances consist of G2 instances which are mainly used for gaming applications that require heavy graphics and 3D application data streaming. It consists of a high-performance NVIDIA GPU which is suitable for audio, video, 3D imaging, and graphics streaming kinds of applications. To run the GPU instances, NVIDIA drivers must be installed.
Memory Optimized Instances
Memory Optimized Instances consists of R3 instances which are designed for memory- intensive applications. R3 instance consists of latest Intel Xeon lvy Bridge processor. R3 instance can sustain a memory bandwidth of 63000 MB/sec. R3 instance offers a high- performance databases, In memory analytics, and distributed memory caches.
Storage Optimized Instances
Storage Optimized Instances consist of two types of instances: I2 and D2 instances.
I2 instance: It provides heavy SSD which is required for the sequential read, and write access to a large data sets. It also provides random I/O operations to your applications. It is best suited for the applications such as high-frequency online transaction processing systems, relational databases, NoSQL databases, Cache for in-memory databases, Data warehousing applications and Low latency Ad- Tech serving applications.

24) Difference between Stopping and Terminating the instances?
Stopping: You can stop an EC2 instance and stopping an instance means shutting down the instance. Its corresponding EBS volume is still attached to an EC2 instance, so you can restart the instance as well.

Terminating: You can also terminate the EC2 instance and terminating an instance means you are removing the instance from your AWS account. When you terminate an instance, then its corresponding EBS is also removed. Due to this reason, you cannot restart the EC2 instance.

25) How many Elastic IPs can you create?
5 elastic IP addresses that you can create per AWS account per region.

26) What is a Load Balancer?

Simple Routing Policy
Simple Routing Policy is a simple round-robin policy which is applied to a single resource doing the function for the domain, For example, web server is sending the content to a website where web server is a single resource.
It responds to DNS queries based on the values present in the resource.
Weighted Routing Policy
Weighted Routing Policy allows you to route the traffic to different resources in specified proportions. For example, 75% in one server, and 25% in another server.
Weights can be assigned in the range from 0 to 255.
Weight Routing policy is applied when there are multiple resources accessing the same function. For example, web servers accessing the same website. Each web server will be given a unique weight number.
Weighted Routing Policy associates the multiple resources to a single DNS name.
Latency-based Routing Policy
Latent-based Routing Policy allows Route53 to respond to the DNS query at which data center gives the lowest latency.

36) Differences between Security group and Network access control list?
Security Group	NACL (Network Access Control List)
It supports only allow rules, and by default, all the rules are denied. You cannot deny the rule for establishing a connection.	It supports both allow and deny rules, and by default, all the rules are denied. You need to add the rule which you can either allow or deny it.
It is a stateful means that any changes made in the inbound rule will be automatically reflected in the outbound rule. For example, If you are allowing an incoming port 80, then you also have to add the outbound rule explicitly.	It is a stateless means that any changes made in the inbound rule will not reflect the outbound rule, i.e., you need to add the outbound rule separately. For example, if you add an inbound rule port number 80, then you also have to explicitly add the outbound rule.
It is associated with an EC2 instance.	It is associated with a subnet.
All the rules are evaluated before deciding whether to allow the traffic.	Rules are evaluated in order, starting from the lowest number.
Security Group is applied to an instance only when you specify a security group while launching an instance.	NACL has applied automatically to all the instances which are associated with an instance.
It is the first layer of defense.	It is the second layer of defense.
37) What are the two types of access that you can provide when you are creating users?
There are two types of access:

Console Access
If the user wants to use the Console Access, a user needs to create a password to login in an AWS account.
Programmatic access
If you use the Programmatic access, an IAM user need to make an API calls. An API call can be made by using the AWS CLI. To use the AWS CLI, you need to create an access key ID and secret access key.
38) What is subnet?
When large section of IP address is divided into smaller units is known as subnet.

AWS Interview Questions
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network provided to your AWS account. When you create a virtual cloud, you need to specify the IPv4 addresses which is in the form of CIDR block. After creating a VPC, you need to create the subnets in each availability zone. Each subnet has a unique ID. When launching instances in each availability zone, it will protect your applications from the failure of a single location.

39) Differences between Amazon S3 and EC2?
S3

It is a storage service where it can store any amount of data.
It consists of a REST interface and uses secure HMAC-SHA1 authentication keys.
EC2

It is a web service used for hosting an application.
It is a virtual machine which can run either Linux or Windows and can also run the applications such as PHP, Python, Apache or other databases.
40) Can you establish a peering connection to a VPC in a different region?
No, it's not possible to establish a peering connection to a VPC in a different region. It's only possible to establish a peering connection to a VPC in the same region.

41) How many subnets can you have per VPC?
You can have 200 subnets per VPC.

42) When EC2 officially launched?

44) What are the types of AMI provided by AWS?
There are two types of AMI provided by AWS:

Instance store backed
An instance-store backed is an EC2 instance whose root device resides on the virtual machine's hard drive.
When you create an instance, then AMI is copied to the instance.
Since "instance store-backed" instances root device is stored in the virtual machine's hard drive, so you cannot stop the instance. You can only terminate the instance, and if you do so, the instance will be deleted and cannot be recovered.
If the virtual machine's hard drive fails, then you can lose your data.
You need to leave this instance-store instance in a running state until you are completely done with it.
You will be charged from the moment when your instance is started until your instance is terminated.
EBS backed
An "EBS backed" instance is an EC2 instance that uses EBS volume as a root device
EBS volumes are not tied to a virtual hardware, but they are restricted to an availability zone. This means that EBS volume is moved from one machine to another machine within the same availability zone.
If the virtual machine's fails, then the virtual machine can be moved to another virtual machine.
The main advantage of "EBS backed" over "instance store-backed" instances is that it can be stopped. When an instance is in a stopped state, then EBS volume can be stored for a later use. The virtual machine is used for some other instance. In stopped state, you are not charged for the EBS storage.
45) What is Amazon EMR?
An Amazon EMR stands for Amazon Elastic MapReduce. It is a web service used to process the large amounts of data in a cost-effective manner. The central component of an Amazon EMR is a cluster. Each cluster is a collection of EC2 instances and an instance in a cluster is known as node. Each node has a specified role attached to it known as a node type, and an Amazon EMR installs the software components on node type.


Following are the node types:

AWS Interview Questions
Master node
A master node runs the software components to distribute the tasks among other nodes in a cluster. It tracks the status of all the tasks and monitors the health of a cluster.
Core node
A core node runs the software components to process the tasks and stores the data in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Multi-node clusters will have at least one core node.
Task node
A task node with software components processes the task but does not store the data in HDFS. Task nodes are optional.
46) How to connect EBS volume to multiple instances?
You cannot connect the EBS volume to multiple instances. But, you can connect multiple EBS volumes to a single instance.

47) What is the use of lifecycle hooks in Autoscaling?
Lifecycle hooks perform custom actions by pausing instances when Autoscaling group launches or terminates an instance. When instance is paused, an instance moves in a wait state. By default, an instance remains in a wait state for 1 hour. For example, when you launch a new instance, lifecycle hooks pauses an instance. When you pause an instance, you can install a software on it or make sure that an instance is completely ready to receive the traffic.

48) What is Amazon Kinesis Firehose?

50) How will you access the data on EBS in AWS?
EBS stands for Elastic Block Store. It is a virtual disk in a cloud that creates the storage volume and attach it to the EC2 instances. It can run the databases as well as can store the files. All the files that it store can be mounted as a file system which can be accessed directly. To know more about EBS, click on the link given below:

Click Here
51) Differences between horizontal scaling and vertical scaling?
Vertical scaling means scaling the compute power such as CPU, RAM to your existing machine while horizontal scaling means adding more machines to your server or database. Horizontal scaling means increasing the number of nodes, and distributing the tasks among different nodes.

AWS Basic Interview Questions
1. What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a platform to provide secure cloud services, database storage, offerings to compute power, content delivery, and other services to help business level and develop.

Take up the AWS Masters Certification Course by Intellipaat and upgrade your skillset.

2. Give the comparison between AWS and OpenStack.
Criteria	AWS	OpenStack
License	Amazon proprietary	Open-source
Operating system	Provided as per the cloud administrator	AMIs provided by AWS
Performing repeatable operations	Through templates	Through text files
3. What is the importance of buffer in Amazon Web Services?
An Elastic Load Balancer ensures that the incoming traffic is distributed optimally across various AWS instances. A buffer will synchronize different components and makes the arrangement additionally elastic to a burst of load or traffic. The components are prone to work in an unstable way of receiving and processing requests. The buffer creates an equilibrium linking various apparatus and crafts them to work at an identical rate to supply more rapid services.

4. How are Spot Instance, On-demand Instance, and Reserved Instance different from one another?
Both Spot Instance and On-demand Instance are models for pricing.

Spot Instance	On-demand Instance
With Spot Instance, customers can purchase compute capacity with no upfront commitment at all.	With On-demand Instance, users can launch instances at any time based on the demand.
Spot Instances are spare Amazon instances that you can bid for.	On-demand Instances are suitable for the high-availability needs of applications.
When the bidding price exceeds the spot price, the instance is automatically launched, and the spot price fluctuates based on supply and demand for instances.	On-demand Instances are launched by users only with the pay-as-you-go model.
When the bidding price is less than the spot price, the instance is immediately taken away by Amazon.	On-demand Instances will remain persistent without any automatic termination from Amazon.
Spot Instances are charged on an hourly basis.	On-demand Instances are charged on a per-second basis
5. Why do we make subnets?
Creating subnets means dividing a large network into smaller ones. These subnets can be created for several reasons. For example, creating and using subnets can help reduce congestion by making sure that the traffic destined for a subnet stays in that subnet. This helps in efficiently routing the traffic coming to the network that reduces the network‚Äôs load.

13. You have connected four instances to ELB. To automatically terminate your unhealthy instances and replace them with new ones, which functionality would you use?
Auto-scaling groups

14. The data on the root volumes of store-backed and EBS-backed instances get deleted by default when they are terminated. If you want to prevent that from happening, which instance would you use?
EBS-backed instances. EBS-backed instances use EBS volume as their root volume. EBS volume consists of virtual drives that can be easily backed up and duplicated by snapshots.

EBS Backed Instances
The biggest advantage of EBS-backed volumes is that the data can be configured to be stored for later retrieval even if the virtual machine or the instances are shut down.

15. How will you configure an Amazon S3 bucket to serve static assets for your public web application?
By configuring the bucket policy to provide public read access to all objects

18. If you launched a standby RDS, will it be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?
No, standby instances are automatically launched in different availability zones than the primary, making them physically independent infrastructures. This is because the whole purpose of standby instances is to prevent infrastructure failure. So, in case the primary goes down, the standby instance will help recover all of the data.

19. What is the name of Amazon's Content Delivery Network ?
Amazon CloudFront

20. Which Amazon solution will you use if you want to accelerate moving petabytes of data in and out of AWS, using storage devices that are designed to be secure for data transfer?
Amazon Snowball. AWS Snowball is the data transport solution for large amounts of data that need to be moved into and out of AWS using physical storage devices.

Session policies
1- Identity-based policies- They are JSON permissions policy documents that control what actions an identity can perform, under what conditions, and on which resources. These policies are further classified into 2 categories:

Managed Policies‚Äì These policies are standalone identity-based policies that can be attached to different users, groups in your AWS environment.
Inline policies- These policies are directly attached to a single user, group, or role. In situations where inline policies are used, a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and an identity is maintained. 
2- Resource-based policies- These policies are the ones attached to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket. They define which actions can be performed on the particular resource and under what circumstances.

3- IAM permissions boundaries- They actually refer to the maximum level of permissions that identity-based policies can grant to the specific entity.

4- Service Control Policies (SCPs)- SCPs are the maximum level of permissions for an organization or organizational unit. 

5- Access Control lists- They define and control which principals in another AWS account can access the particular resource.

6- Session policies- They are advanced policies that are passed as a parameter when a temporary session is programmatically created for a role or federated user.

62. What kind of IP address can you use for your customer gateway (CGW) address?

AWS Scenario Based Questions
64. A Company has a running Web Application Server in the N. Virginia region and the server has a large size EBS volume of approximately 500 GB, and to see the demand of business, the company needs to migrate the server from the current region to another AWS account‚Äôs Mumbai location. Which is the best way to migrate the server from the current location to the Mumbai region? And what information AWS administrator does require about AWS A/C?
Create an AMI of the server running in the North Virginia region. Once the AMI is created, The administrator would need the 12 digit account number of the #2 AWS account. This is required for copying the AMI which we have created.

Once the AMI is successfully copied into the Mumbai region, you can launch the instance using copied AMI in the Mumbai region. Once the instance is running and if it‚Äôs completely operational, the server in the North Virginia region could be terminated. This is the best way to migrate a server to a different account without any hassle.


65. Unable to ping Instance We launched a Windows 2019 IIS server in the Ohio region and deployed a dynamic website in this server, in addition, the webserver also connected with a backend MS-SQL server to store and access data related to the application. Our users were able to access the website over the Internet. The next day our client informed us that they were able to access the website, but weren‚Äôt able to ping the server from the Internet. To ensure ICMP rule in Security Group, we checked, and the Security Group had allowed rule from 0.0.0.0/0. Would you try to help troubleshoot the issue?
If the client is able to access the website from his/her end, it means the connection is perfect and no issue with connectivity and the Security Group configuration also seems correct.

We can check the internal firewall of the Windows 2019 IIS server. If it is blocking ICMP traffic, we should enable it.

66. A start-up company has a web application based in the us-east-1 Region with multiple Amazon EC2 instances running behind an Application Load Balancer across multiple Availability Zones. As the company's user base grows in the us-west-1 region, the company needs a solution with low latency and improved high availability. What should a solutions architect do to achieve it.?
You need to notice here, currently, the web application is in us-ease-1, and the user base grows in the us-east-1 region. The very first step, provision multiple EC2 instances (web application servers) and configure an Application Load Balancer in us-west-1. Now, create Global Accelerator in AWS Global Accelerator which uses an endpoint group that includes the load balancer endpoints in both Regions.

67. A company currently operates a web application backed by an Amazon RDS MySQL database. It has automated backups that are run daily and are not encrypted. A security audit requires future backups to be encrypted and unencrypted backups to be destroyed. The company will make at least one encrypted backup before destroying the old backups. What should be done to enable encryption for future backups?
Create a snapshot of the database.
Copy it to an encrypted snapshot.
Restore the database from the encrypted snapshot.
68. A company is going to launch one branch in the UK and need to continue with its existing main branch in the USA. The company has almost 15 GB of data which is stored in an S3 Bucket in the Ohio region and data is stored with the default storage class. The Company also wants to provide its updated & stored data in the London S3 bucket using one zone accessibility storage class to save storage costs. In addition, the company also wants that the data must be updated automatically in S3‚Äôs London bucket; if any data is modified or written in the S3 bucket in Ohio.
Configure Cross Region Replication Rule in Ohio region bucket and select destination bucket in the London region to replicate the data and store it in destination using one zone IA storage class to save cost.

69. You are an AWS Architect in your company, and you are asked to create a new VPC in the N.Virginia Region with two Public and two Private subnets using the following CIDR blocks:
VPC CIDR = 10.10.10.0/24

Public Subnet

Subnet01 : 10.10.10.0/26
Subnet02 : 10.10.10.64/26

Private Subnet

Subnet03: 10.10.10.128/26
Subnet04: 10.10.10.192/26

Using the above CIDRs you created a new VPC, and you launched EC2 instances in all subnets as per the need.

Now, you are facing an issue in private instances that you are unable to update operating systems from the internet. So, what architectural changes and configurations will you suggest to resolve the issue?

NAT G/W to be installed in one public subnet and will configure the route-table associated with private subnets to add NAT G/W entry to provide internet access to private instances.

70. The data on the root volumes of store-backed and EBS-backed instances get deleted by default when they are terminated. If you want to prevent that from happening, which instance would you use? And ensure if the EC2 instance is restarted, the data or configuration in the EC2 instance should not be lost.
EBS-backed instances or instances with EBS Volume. EBS-backed instances use EBS volume as their root volume. These volumes contain Operating Systems, Applications, and Data. We can create Snapshots from these volumes or AMI from Snapshots.

The main advantage of EBS-backed volume is that the data can be configured to be stored for later retrieval even if the virtual machine or the instances are shut down.

71. You have an application running on an EC2 instance. You need to reduce the load on your instance as soon as the CPU utilization reaches 80 percent. How will you accomplish the job?
It can be done by creating an autoscaling group to deploy more instances when the CPU utilization of the EC2 instance exceeds 80 percent and distributing traffic among instances by creating an application load balancer and registering EC2 instances as target instances.

74. An application running on AWS uses an Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ deployment for its database. When evaluating performance metrics, a solutions architect discovered that the database reads are causing high I/O and adding latency to the write requests against the database. What should the solutions architect do to separate the read requests from the write requests?
Create a read replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoint.

75. A client reports that they wanted to see an audit log of any changes made to AWS resources in their account. What can the client do to achieve this?
Enable AWS CloudTrail logs to be delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket

76. Usually, you have noticed that one EBS volume can be connected with one EC2 instance, our company wants to run a business-critical application on multiple instances in a single region and need to store all instances output in single storage within the VPC. Instead of using EFS, our company is recommending the use of multi-attach volume with instances. As an architect, you need to suggest them what instance type and EBS volumes they should use.
The instance type should be EC2 Nitro-based instances and Provisioned IOPs io1 multi-attach EBS volumes.

77. A company is using a VPC peering connection option to connect its multiple VPCs in a single region to allow for cross VPC communication. A recent increase in account creations and VPCs has made it difficult to maintain the VPC peering strategy, and the company expects to grow to hundreds of VPCs. There are also new requests to create site-to-site VPNs with some of the VPCs. A solutions architect has been tasked with creating a centrally networking setup for multiple accounts and VPNs. Which networking solution would you recommend to resolve it?
Configure a transit gateway with AWS Transit Gateway and connect all VPCs and VPNs.

78. An organization has multiple facilities in various continents such as North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. The organization is designing a new distributed application to manage and optimize its global supply chain and its manufacturing process. It needs to design the process in such a way that the booked order in one continent should be able to support data failover with a short Recovery Time Objective (RTO).

Currently, there are more than 200 services and products offered by AWS in various fields like IoT (Internet of Things), mobile development, data analytics, networking, etc. 

Many of their services are not directly accessible to the end-users as AWS offers developer APIs for it. The web services provided by AWS are also widely used over HTTP for business purposes.

What is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), and also explain its features?
EC2 is part of the AWS services and enables users to rent virtual computers and run their programs. One can deploy applications on a large scale with the help of EC2. EC2 helps users to boot an AMI (Amazon Machine Language) to access a virtual machine. Amazon‚Äôs configuration of a virtual machine via AMI is called an ‚Äòinstance‚Äô. You can launch, create, and stop many server instances with the help of EC2 for your business/organization. You will have to pay per second for the number of active servers while using EC2 for your business/firm. 

Besides offering various virtual operating systems, EC2 also provides persistent storage and elastic IP addresses. Amazon CloudWatch is another service widely used by EC2 customers as it helps them monitor resource utilization. You can monitor the usage of CPU, network, etc., of RDS database replicas using Amazon CloudWatch. The auto-scaling feature of EC2 helps in adapting according to the traffic. For example, if someone uses EC2 for their e-commerce site, it will automatically scale up if the traffic on the site increases.

Discuss the pricing models for the Amazon EC2 instance
This is one of the important AWS interview questions for experienced posts. Read on to know more AWS interview questions and answers for experienced/senior posts.

There are four types of pricing models for Amazon EC2 instances that are as follows:

On-demand instance ‚Äì On-demand pricing or pay-as-you-go model allows you to pay only for the resources used till now. Depending on the instances, you will have to pay by second/hour for the resources. The on-demand pricing model is good if the work hours are short and unpredictable as they do not require any upfront payment.
Reserved instance ‚Äì It is the best model to use if you have a prerequisite for your upcoming requirements. Firms calculate their future EC2 requirements and pay upfront to get a discount of up to 75%. Reserved instances will save computing capacity for you, and you can use them wherever required.
Spot Instance ‚Äì If some extra amount of computing capacity is required immediately, one can opt for spot instances at up to a 90% discount. The unused computing capacity is sold at a heavily discounted rate via the spot instance pricing model.
Dedicated hosts ‚Äì A customer can reserve a physical EC2 server by opting for the dedicated hosts pricing model.
4. What is Amazon S3? Elaborate.

S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides scalable object storage space to firms and IT professionals. It is one of the earliest services introduced by AWS. The easy-to-use web services interface of S3 allows users to store and retrieve data from remote locations. S3 contains buckets to store files/data.

Users create a bucket in the S3 and name it as if it is a universal namespace. An HTTP 200 code is received on successful uploading of a file to the assigned S3 bucket. A unique name is given to each bucket to generate the DNS address (unique).

You can also download the data from a bucket in S3 and permit other users to download it. The authentication mechanism of S3 helps in securing the data from any possible breaches.

5. Your organization has decided to transfer its business processes to the public cloud. However, they want some of their information/data to be accessed only by the management team. The rest of the resources will be shared among the employees of the firm. You must suggest a suitable cloud architecture for your firm and the reason of choice.

This question is one of the critical AWS interview questions. Scenario-based AWS interview questions highlight the candidate‚Äôs experimental knowledge and industry approach.

I will suggest hybrid cloud architecture for my organization. Hybrid cloud architecture has the perfect blend of private and public clouds. One can use the public cloud in the hybrid architecture for the shared resources in my firm. The confidential resources can only be shared with the management team using a private cloud.

We can enjoy the services of both private and public clouds by installing a hybrid cloud architecture in our firm. Depending on the data security requirements, a hybrid cloud allows data to be accessed at different levels in an organization/firm. It will help our firm in cutting costs in the long run.

6. Explain various types of cloud service models in brief.

There are three types of cloud services models that are:

IaaS ‚Äì Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) allows users to access virtual computing resources with the help of the internet. A service provider hosts servers, storage, hardware, etc., on behalf of the users via IaaS. IaaS platforms offer high scalability and can adapt according to the workload. IaaS providers also manage tasks of their users like system maintenance, backup, resilience, etc.
PaaS ‚Äì Platform as a Service (PaaS) helps service providers to deliver software and hardware tools to their users. It is especially used for the application development process, and one can receive applications from the service provider via the internet using PaaS. Users do not have to own in-house software/hardware for application development/testing as they can do it with the help of PaaS.
SaaS ‚Äì Software as a Service (SaaS) is a widely sold model by service providers for software distribution. On-demand computing software can be delivered using SaaS to the users/customers. The SaaS model is preferred as it is easy to administer and manage patches.
7. Describe RTO & RPO from AWS perspective?

RTO (Recovery Time Objective) refers to the maximum waiting time for AWS services/operations resumption during an outage/disaster. Due to unexpected failure, firms have to wait for the recovery process, and the maximum waiting time for an organization is defined as the RTO. When an organization starts using AWS, they have to set its RTO, which can also be called a metric. It defines the time firms can wait during disaster recovery of applications and business processes on AWS. Organizations calculate their RTO as part of their BIA (Business Impact Analysis).

Like RTO, RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is also a business metric calculated by a business as part of its BIA. RPO defines the amount of data a firm can afford to lose during an outage or disaster. It is measured in a particular time frame within the recovery period. RPO also defines the frequency of data backup in a firm/organization. For example, if a firm uses AWS services and its RPO is 3 hours, then it implies that all its data/disk volumes will be backed up every three hours.

8. Explain the auto-scaling feature of EC2 along with its benefits.

The auto-scaling feature in AWS EC2 automatically scales up the computing capacity according to the need. It helps in maintaining a steady performance of business processes. Auto Scaling can help scale multiple AWS resources within a few minutes. Besides EC2, one can also choose to automatically scale other AWS resources and tools as and when needed. The benefits of the EC2 auto-scaling feature are as follows:

The auto-scaling feature of AWS EC2 is easy to set up. The utilization levels of various resources can be found under the same interface. You do not have to move to different consoles to check the utilization level of multiple resources.
The auto-scaling feature is innovative and automates the scaling processes. It also monitors the response of various resources to changes and scales them automatically. Besides adding computing capacity, the auto-scaling feature also removes/lessens the computing capacity if needed.
Even if the workload is unpredictable, the auto-scaling feature optimizes the application‚Äôs performance. The optimum performance level of an application is maintained with the help of auto-scaling.
9. What are S3 storage classes, and explain various types of S3 storage classes?

S3 storage classes are used for data integrity and assisting concurrent data loss. Whatever object you store in S3 will be associated with a respective storage class. It is also involved in maintaining the object lifecycle, which helps in automatic migration and thus saves cost. The four types of S3 storage classes are as follows:

S3 Standard ‚Äì The data is duplicated and stored across multiple devices in various facilities via the S3 Standard storage class. A loss of a maximum of 2 facilities simultaneously can be coped up via the S3 standard. Its low latency and high throughput provide increased durability and availability.
 S3 Standard IA ‚Äì ‚ÄòS3 Standard Infrequently Accessed‚Äô is used for conditions when data is not accessed regularly, but it should be fast when there is a need to access data. Like S3 Standard, it can also sustain the loss of data at a maximum of 2 facilities concurrently. 
S3 One Zone Infrequent Access ‚Äì Many of its features are similar to that of S3 Standard IA. The primary difference between S3, one zone infrequent access, and the rest of the storage class is that its availability is low, i.e., 99.5%. The availability of S3 standard and standard IA is 99.99%.
S3 Glacier ‚Äì S3 glacier provides the cheapest storage class as compared to other storage classes. One can only use the data stored in the S3 glacier for the archive.
10. Suppose your firm is hosting an application on AWS that helps users render images and perform general computation tasks. Your firm‚Äôs management team has suggested using an application load balancer for routing the incoming traffic on the hosted application. Explain how an application load balancer is a good choice for routing the incoming traffic.

This question is an example of scenario-based AWS interview questions. Besides having theoretical knowledge, a candidate should also know about the industry uses and working of various AWS services. 

The user‚Äôs requests regarding image rendering can only be directed to the image rendering servers, while the general computing users can be directed to the computing servers. This will help balance the load on various servers and access them when needed.

11. What is a policy in AWS? Explain various types of AWS policies in brief.

A policy is an object in AWS that is associated with a respective resource and defines whether the user request is to be granted or not. The six different types of policies in AWS are as follows:

 Identity-based policies ‚Äì These policies are concerned with an identity user, multiple users, or any particular role. Identity-based policies store permissions in the JSON format. They are also further divided into managed and inline policies.
Resource-based policies ‚Äì The policies that are concerned with resources in AWS are called resource-based policies. An example of a resource in AWS is the S3 bucket.
Permissions boundaries ‚Äì Permissions boundaries define the maximum number of permissions that can be granted to an object/entity by identity-based policies.
 SCP ‚Äì SCP (Service Control Policies) are also stored in JSON format and define the maximum number of permissions concerning a firm/organization.
ACL ‚Äì ACL (Access Control Lists) defines the principles in some other AWS account that can access the resources. It is also the only AWS policy that is not stored in the JSON format.
Session policies ‚Äì Session policies limit the number of permissions granted by a user‚Äôs identity-based policies.
12. Explain in detail about AWS VPC.

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) lets a user launch AWS resources into a virtual network defined by the user only. Since the user defines the virtual network, various aspects of the virtual network can be controlled by the user, like subnet creation, IP address, etc.

Firms can install a virtual network within their organization and use all the AWS benefits for that network. Users can also create a routing table for their virtual network using VPC. A routing table is a set of rules that defines the direction of the incoming traffic.

The communication between your virtual network and the internet can also be established using the internet gateway offered by AWS VPC. One can access the VPC offered by Amazon via various interfaces that are AWS management console, AWS CLI (Command Line Interface), AWS SDKs, and Query API. Users can pay for additional VPC components if required like NAT gateway, traffic mirroring, private link, etc.

13. You have recently assigned various EC2 instances for your business website across different availability zones. Since your website performs a large number of reading/writing operations per minute, you have also used a Multi-AZ RDS DB instance (extra-large). It was going smoothly as per your plans until you discovered read contention on RDS MySQL. How are you going to solve this issue to enhance the performance of your website?

This question is one of the prominent technical AWS interview questions asked. Besides knowing about the cloud deployment services of AWS, candidates should also focus on the database services offered by Amazon.

I will install/deploy ElastiCache in the various availability zones of EC2 instances. Deploying ElastiCache in the memory cache of different availability zones will create a cached version of my website in various zones. RDS MySQL read replica will then be added to each availability zone for faster performance of the website. Since the ‚ÄòRDS MySQL read replica‚Äô is added to each availability zone, it will not further load on the RDS MySQL instance, thus solving the read contention issue. Users can also access my website quickly in various availability zones as a cached version is created in each zone.

14. Your firm wants to connect the data center of its organization to the Amazon cloud environment for faster accessibility and performance. What course of action will you suggest for the stated scenario?

AWS data engineer interview questions can be asked if a candidate is applying for data scientist/engineer. The data center of my firm can be connected to the Amazon cloud environment with the help of VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). I suggest my firm establish a virtual private network and connect VPC and the data center. My firm can then launch AWS resources in the virtual private network using VPC. A virtual private network will establish a secure connection between the firm‚Äôs data center and the AWS global network. Adding cloud services to our organization will help us do more work in less time while successfully slashing costs in the long run.

I would also suggest creating multiple backups of the company data before moving it successfully to the cloud. AWS offers affordable backup plans, and one can also automate backups after a fixed interval.

15. Explain various types of elastic load balancers in AWS.

Elastic load balancing in AWS supports three different types of load balancers. The load balancers are used to route the incoming traffic in AWS. The three types of load balancers in AWS are as follows:

Application load balancer ‚Äì The application load balancer is concerned with the routing decisions made at the application layer. It does path-based routing at the HTTP/HTTPS (layer 7). It also helps in routing requests to various container instances. Using the application load balancer, you can route a request to more than one port in the container instances.
Network load balancer ‚Äì The network load balancer is concerned with routing decisions made at the transport layer (SSL/TCP). It uses a flow hash routing algorithm to determine the target on the port from the group of targets. Once the target is selected, a TCP connection is established with the chosen target based on the known listener configuration.
Classic load balancer ‚Äì A classic load balancer can decide on either the application or transport layer. One can map a load balancer port to only one container instance (fixed mapping) via the classic load balancer.
16. What do you know about NAT gateways in AWS?

NAT (Network Address Translation) is an AWS service that helps in connecting an EC2 instance to the internet. The EC2 instance used via NAT should be in a private subnet. The internet and NAT can also help connect an EC2 instance to other AWS services.

Since we are using the EC2 instance in a private subnet, connecting to the internet via any other means would make it public. NAT helps in retaining the private subnet while establishing a connection between the EC2 instance and the internet. Users can create NAT gateways or NAT instances for establishing a connection between EC2 instances and internet/AWS services.

NAT instances are single EC2 instances, while NAT gateways can be used across various availability zones. If you are creating a NAT instance, it will support a fixed amount of traffic decided by the instance‚Äôs size.

17. Explain various AWS RDS database types in brief.

Various types of AWS RDS database types are as follows:

Amazon Aurora ‚Äì Aurora database is strictly developed in AWS RDS, which means it cannot run on any local device with an AWS infrastructure. This relational database is preferred for its enhanced availability and speed.
PostgreSQL ‚Äì PostgreSQL is a relational database that is developed especially for start-ups and AWS developers. This easy-to-use and open-source database help users in scaling deployments in the cloud environment. Not only the PostgreSQL deployments are fast, but they are also cost-effective (economical).
MySQL ‚Äì It is also an open-source database used for its high scalability during deployments in the cloud.
MariaDB ‚Äì MariaDB is an open-source database used to deploy scalable servers in the cloud environment. You can deploy MariaDB servers in the cloud environment within a few minutes. The scalable MariaDB server deployment is also cost-effective. MariaDB is also preferred for its management of administrative jobs like scaling, replication, software patching, etc.
Oracle ‚Äì Oracle is a relational database in AWS RDS that can also scale the respective deployments in the cloud. Just like MariaDB, it also performs the management of various administrative tasks.
SQL server ‚Äì It is another relational database that can also manage administrative tasks like scaling, backup, replication, etc. Users can deploy multiple versions of SQL servers in the cloud within minutes. The SQL server deployment is also cost-effective in AWS.
18. What do you know about Amazon Redshift?

Redshift is a data warehouse service offered by Amazon that is deployed in the cloud. It is fast and highly scalable as compared to other data warehouses in the cloud. On average, Redshift provides around ten times more performance & speed than different data warehouses in the cloud. It uses new-age technologies like machine learning, columnar storage, etc., that justify its high stability and performance. You can scale up to petabytes and terabytes using AWS Redshift.

Redshift uses OLAP as its analytics processing system and comprises two nodes for storing data/information. Its advanced compression and parallel processing offers high speed during AWS operations in the cloud. One can easily add new nodes in the warehouse using AWS Redshift. Developers can answer a query faster and can also solve complex problems using Redshift.

19. What do you know about AMI?

AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is used to create a virtual machine within the EC2 environment. The services that are delivered via EC2 are deployed with the help of AMI only. The main part of AMI is its read-only filesystem image that also comprises an operating system. AMI also consists of launch permission that decides which AWS account is permitted to launch instances using AMI. The volumes are attached to an instance while the launching process is decided by block device mapping in AMI. The AMI consists of three different types of images.

A Public image is an AMI that any user/client can use, while users can also opt for a ‚ÄòPaid‚Äô AMI. You can also use a ‚ÄòShared‚Äô AMI that provides more flexibility to the developer. Users can access A shared AMI which is allowed as per the developer‚Äôs orders.

20. Explain horizontal and vertical scaling in AWS?

This question is among the AWS basic interview questions asked to a candidate. It is also one of the important AWS interview questions for freshers. Read on to know the answer to this AWS interview question.

When RDS/EC2 servers alter the instance size for scaling purposes, it is called vertical scaling. A larger instance size is picked for scaling up in vertical scaling, while a smaller instance size is picked for scaling down. The size of the instance is altered on-demand via vertical scaling in AWS. 

Unlike vertical scaling, an instance‚Äôs size is altered per the requirements of horizontal scaling. A system‚Äôs number of nodes/instances is changed without altering their size via horizontal scaling. The horizontal auto-scaling is based on the number of connections between an instance and the integrated ELB (Elastic Load Balancer).

21. What are the main differences between AWS and OpenStack?

Both AWS and OpenStack are indulged in providing cloud computing services to their users. AWS is owned and distributed by Amazon, whereas OpenStack is an open-source cloud computing platform. AWS offers various cloud computing services and IaaS, PaaS, etc., whereas OpenStack is an IaaS cloud computing platform. You can use OpenStack for free as it is open source, but you have to pay for AWS services as you use it.

Another significant difference between AWS and OpenStack is in terms of performing repeatable operations. While AWS performs repeatable functions via templates, OpenStack does it via text files. OpenStack is good for understanding and learning cloud computing, but AWS is better and equipped for businesses. AWS also offers business development tools that OpenStack does not offer.

22. What do you know about AWS CloudTrail?

People using an AWS account can audit it using the AWS CloudTrail. It also helps in ensuring compliance and governance of the AWS account. As soon as an AWS account is activated, CloudTrail also starts working and records every AWS activity as an event. One can visit the CloudTrail console anytime and can view recent events/actions. All the efforts by a user or a role are recorded in the CloudTrail. The actions taken by various AWS services are also recorded in CloudTrail.

With CloudTrail, you will have enhanced visibility of your AWS account and the associated actions. In an AWS infrastructure in any organization, you can quickly get to know any particular activity and gain control over the AWS infrastructure.

23. What do you know about AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a computing platform provided as a part of the AWS services that do not need servers to perform activities. Any code compiled on AWS Lambda will run in response to events, and it identifies the resources required for code compilation automatically. AWS Lambda supports various coding languages like Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, etc. With AWS Lambda, you will pay only for the time your code is being executed. You will not be charged any amount when you are not using any computer time.

Besides running your code in response to events, you can also run your code in response to HTTP requests via AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda will automatically manage various resources like memory, network, CPU, etc., while you run a code on it.

24. Your firm has been using AWS services for a year now. You are a senior developer in your company and have been asked to analyze your firm‚Äôs amount for AWS services. How will you analyze the cost spent on AWS services to ensure that you are not paying more than you use?

Cost management can be an important topic of discussion in AWS interview questions. Also, this question is an example of AWS scenario-based interview questions.

I will refer to the ‚ÄòTop Services Table,‚Äô which is visible in the cost management console of AWS. It will let me know about the top five services being used by our firm and how much money we are spending on those services. I will also take the aid of cost explorer services offered by AWS that will let me analyze the last 13 months‚Äô usage and associated costs.

One can use the cost allocation tags to identify the AWS resource that has cost more than other services in any particular month.

25. You have to upload a file of around 120 megabytes in Amazon S3. How will you approach the uploading of this file?

A file that has a size of more than 100 megabytes can be uploaded in Amazon S3 using the multipart upload utility offered by AWS. Multipart upload utility will allow me to upload the 120 megabytes file into multiple parts. All the parts of the large file will be uploaded individually using the multipart upload utility. Once all the original files are uploaded, one can merge to get the original file with 120 megabytes.

Using a multipart upload utility will help me in decreasing the upload time significantly. AWS S3 commands can be used for multipart uploading and downloading. AWS S3 commands are also capable of automatically performing multipart uploading/downloading after evaluating the file size.

26. Your firm has an application that runs on AWS, and the management decides that they want to inculcate email functionality in their application. How will you approach this scenario as part of your firm‚Äôs management team?

Amazon offers various services for a diverse range of use cases that work well with AWS-based applications. You should know about other Amazon services that go well with AWS, as AWS interview questions can be based on them. 

I recommend using the Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) to integrate email functionality with our AWS-based application. SES can help us set up various types of mail forwarding services like mass mailing, transactional mailing, marketing mailing, etc. SES is a cost-effective solution for integrating email functionality within multiple applications. The scalable SES service is highly secure and can help my firm send emails globally.

27. Explain an AWS service that one can use to protect the AWS infrastructure from DDoS attacks.

For safeguarding the applications running on AWS from any kind of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, we can use AWS Shield. AWS Shield can automatically identify a DDoS attack and will reduce application downtime and latency. A firm doesn‚Äôt have to contact Amazon tech support as all the protective measures can be automated via AWS Shield. All AWS users are subjected to automatic protection against DDoS attacks via AWS Shield Standard. However, for protection against large/organized DDoS attacks, one can use the AWS Shield Advanced services. 

AWS Shield Advanced protects AWS-based applications against various sophisticated DDoS attacks on the network and transport layer. It also provides real-time visibility and monitoring at the time of any DDoS attack on the AWS applications.

28. What do you know about Amazon CloudWatch? Explain its benefits in brief.

Amazon CloudWatch helps monitor the AWS services and resources being used in real-time. CloudWatch uses various metrics that help understand the AWS resources and services being used. Via CloudWatch can also view the metrics related to customized AWS applications as the CloudWatch dashboard is also customizable. By default, CloudWatch displays various metrics associated with AWS services being used. One can customize and choose a set of metrics to be shown by CloudWatch.

One can access CloudWatch services via various means like CloudWatch console, AWS CLI, CloudWatch API, and AWS SDKs. Besides resource utilization, we can also monitor the operational health of AWS services via CloudWatch.

29. Explain the various types of virtualization in AWS in brief.

There are three types of virtualization in AWS that are as follows:

HVM ‚Äì HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) helps in the full virtualization of hardware where all the virtual hardware machines act as an individual unit. Once AWS AMI virtualization is done, the virtual machines execute the master boot record to boot themselves. The root block device of the created AWS machine image contains the master boot record executed by virtual machines.
PV ‚Äì PV (Paravirtualization) is virtualization to a lighter degree as compared to HVM. The guest OS in PV will require some modifications before performing anything. These modifications help users export a scalable and modified hardware version to the virtual machines.
PV on HVM ‚Äì Paravirtualization on HVM can also be done for increased functionality. Operating systems can get access to storage and network I/O through the host via PV on HVM.
30. For encrypting the AWS data in the US region, a key was created from the company headquarters in Asia. Various users and a substitute AWS account were also added to the key. However, the key was not listed while encrypting an object in S3 in the US. What is the problem which the officials in the US aren‚Äôt able to list the key?

This question is an example of AWS interview questions for freshers. Scenario-based AWS interview questions define the industry-oriented approach of the candidates.

The AWS data that needs to be encrypted should be in the same region where one creates the key. In the given scenario, the data is encrypted in the USA region. But the key was created in the Asia region. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you link an external AWS account in another region while the data encryption is to be done in another region.

31. What do you know about the cross-region replication service offered by AWS?

Cross-region replication is used when one needs to copy data from one bucket to another. The main benefit of cross-region replication is that it allows you to replicate data from one bucket to another while both buckets are in different regions. One can do Asynchronous copying of data across buckets in the same AWS management console via cross-region replication.

The bucket from which the data/object is being copied is called the Source Bucket, while the other is called the Destination Bucket. Versioning should be enabled in both the source and destination buckets for availing of cross-region replication. Once you have uploaded a set of data in the destination bucket, you cannot upload/replicate the same data from the source bucket.

32. Explain what you know about CloudFront CDN.

CloudFront CDN (Computer Delivery Network) is a group of distributed servers used to deliver web content like webpages, etc. The delivery done by CloudFront CDN is based on the geographic region of the user, webpage origin, and the server being used for content delivery. The origin of all the files that are to be distributed by the CDN needs to be defined. An origin for CDN can be an S3 bucket, an AWS instance, or an elastic load balancer.

Two types of distribution are done by CloudFront CDN, web distribution and RTMP. Web distribution is used for websites, whereas RTMP is used for media streaming. There are around 50 edge locations distributed in various parts of the world. Edge locations are sites where the web content is cached during delivery.

33. What do you know about AWS Web Application Firewall (WSF)?

AWS WAF is a firewall service that protects web applications from being exploited. They protect web applications against bots that may reduce the applications‚Äô performance or unnecessarily consume resources. Users can control the incoming traffic on their web applications with the help of AWS WAF. Besides bot traffic, we can also prevent various common attacks on the web application via AWS WAF.

Users can create their traffic rule via AWS WAF to restrict any particular traffic pattern affecting the web applications‚Äô performance. AWS WAF offers an API used to define the set of rules for governing the incoming traffic and automate the creation of security rules for web applications.

34. What is the Simple Notification Service offered by AWS?

Simple Notification Service (SNS) offered by AWS is a means of sending messages from one application to another. It is a cost-effective solution that helps users publish messages from any particular application and forward them to other applications. SNS can also send push notifications to various mobile devices like Apple, Google, Windows phones, etc. One can also send an email/SMS to an HTTP endpoint using AWS SNS.

The best feature of SNS is that multiple types of endpoints can be grouped. SNS also supports various types of endpoints under one topic. For example, one can group Apple and Android recipients using SNS and send messages to all subscribers. SNS stores the messages already published in various availability zones to prevent any type of data loss.

35. Your firm has offices in various parts of the world and is involved in multi-regional deployment on AWS. For data persistence, your firm uses MYSQL 5.6. Your firm has recently announced that it needs to regularly collect batch process data from each region and generate regional reports. The reports will then be forwarded to various branch offices. What course of action will you suggest to perform this task in the shortest possible time?

AWS interview questions can also be based on server deployment and database-related issues. This question is an example of AWS interview questions for experienced posts. 

I will suggest creating an RDS instance as a master for managing the firm‚Äôs database. For collecting/reading reports from various locations, we can create a read replica of the RDS instance in various regional headquarters. Installing a read replica at multiple locations will help us in reading reports in less time.

36. Your firm‚Äôs application is responsible for retrieving data from your subscriber‚Äôs/user‚Äôs mobile devices every 10 minutes. The retrieved data is stored in DynamoDB. The information is extracted into S3 for each user. Once the data is extracted, the application helps in data visualization on the user end. As a senior architect in your firm, you are asked to optimize the backend architecture so that the firm can slash costs. What are your recommendations?

AWS interview questions can change according to the different job roles applied for. This question is an example of AWS architect interview questions.

I would recommend using Amazon Elasticache to cache the data stored in DynamoDB. Using Elasticache will reduce the provisioned read throughput without affecting the performance of the system. Using Elasticache will also help our firm slash the cost as it is cheaper than any other provisioned IO.

37. What do you know about Amazon EMR?

Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) is a web service that is widely used for data processing. Amazon EMR consists of a group of EC2 instances that are known as clusters. Cluster is the central component of Amazon EMR with a group of EC2 instances. A single EC2 instance in a cluster is called a node, and each node has a specific role attached to it. Node type defines the particular role connected to any node in a cluster. 

Amazon EMR also consists of a master node responsible for defining the roles of other nodes in a cluster. The master node is also responsible for monitoring the performance of various nodes and their overall health.

38. What do you know about the S3 transfer acceleration service offered by Amazon?

S3 transfer acceleration is used to make uploads to S3 quickly. S3 transfer acceleration does not upload directly to an S3 bucket as it uploads the file to the nearest edge location. A distinct URL is used by S3 transfer acceleration to upload the file to the nearest edge location and then transfer it to the required S3 bucket.

The cloudFront edge network is utilized by S3 transfer acceleration to make uploads quickly and optimizes the transfer process. The edge location to which the file is uploaded will automatically transfer the file to the S3 bucket in less time. The data between clients and S3 buckets can be securely transferred using Amazon‚Äôs S3 transfer acceleration service. 

39. Describe the core services of Amazon Kinesis in brief.

Kinesis is a data streaming platform offered by Amazon. There are three core services of Amazon kinesis that are as follows:

Kinesis Streams ‚Äì While data streaming, the produced data is stored in shards containing the storage sections of Kinesis Streams. The consumers can then access the stored data in shards and turn it into useful data. Once the customers/consumers are done with the data stored in shards, it is moved to other AWS storage like DynamoDB, S3, etc.
Kinesis Firehose ‚Äì Kinesis Firehose is used to deliver streaming data to various AWS destinations like S3, Redshift, Elasticsearch, etc.
Kinesis Analytics ‚Äì One can analyze the streaming data, and rich insights can be collected using Kinesis Analytics. You can run SQL queries on the data stored within Kinesis Firehose via Kinesis Analytics.
40. Explain some of the advantages of using AWS RDS.

AWS interview questions are likely to be framed around AWS RDS as it is one of the most widely used database services in the world.

The benefits of using AWS RDS are as follows:

While using AWS RDS, you can individually control/tweak various database services like CPU, storage, etc..
AWS RDS helps enable automatic backup and update your database servers to the latest configuration.
AWS RDS also creates a backup instance that can be used at the time of failover and prevents data loss.
You can distribute the read traffic by creating RDS read replicas from the source database.
41. State the differences between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

AWS CloudFormation is responsible for provisioning all the resources that are available within a cloud environment. It is also used to describe all the infrastructural resources in a cloud environment. Contrary to AWS CloudFormation, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a suitable environment to deploy and operate applications within the cloud. 

The infrastructural need of applications running in the cloud is fulfilled by AWS CloudFormation, whereas AWS Elastic Beanstalk manages the lifecycle of applications deployed in the cloud. You can fulfill various infrastructural needs of various types of applications deployed in the cloud via AWS CloudFormation like enterprise applications, legacy applications, etc. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is not concerned with the types of applications as it is combined with the developer tolls to govern the lifecycle of deployed applications.

42. Explain the working of AWS config with AWS CloudTrail.

AWS CloudTrail is widely used for recording the user API activity associated with a particular AWS account. One can monitor various API activities using AWS CloudTrail, like response element, caller identity, call duration, etc. When you use AWS Config with CloudTrail, you know the configuration details associated with the AWS resources used. If something is wrong with your AWS resources, both AWS config and CloudTrail can help you identify them.

AWS config is more concerned with the changes that have been made to the AWS resources, whereas CloudTrail is concerned with the user that has made the changes. You can use both of them simultaneously for enhanced governance, compliance, and security policies.

43. What to do so I never lose my connectivity even if my AWS Direct Connect fails?

One needs to configure a backup AWS Direct Connect for situations where the original one fails. Configuring a backup will help you shift connectivity to the second one if the original one fails. You can do BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) to detect failure conditions faster and generate backup accordingly.

One can also configure backup on an IPsec VPN connection so that the traffic can be automatically backed up. While using an IPsec VPN connection backup, all the traffic will be directed to the internet in case of a failure. If you haven‚Äôt ensured any of these backup methods, you will lose your connectivity whenever a failure occurs.

44. Suppose a request for any particular content is made in CloudFront, but the content is not present in the nearest edge location. What will happen in this scenario?

CloudFront always caches data to the nearest edge location before delivering the data to various users. If one requests a particular content via CloudFront and the content is not stored in the nearest edge location, it will be delivered from the original server. The user‚Äôs request will not go in vain as the content will be delivered. However, we may increase the latency as the content is being delivered from the original server and not from the nearest edge location.

In this case, a cached version of the data will also be stored in the nearest edge location. So we can reduce the latency if a request for the same data is made again. Only for the first time will it be delivered from the original server.

It is another example of ‚ÄòAWS interview questions that are scenario-based. It is also a type of AWS cloud architect interview question.

Yes, one should launch the EC2 instances in a VPC. VPC is the best way of connecting the EC2 instances to our firm‚Äôs data center. Once each instance is connected to the VPC, we can easily assign a predetermined IP address to each EC2 instance. It will help to access the public cloud resources easily, like they are stored in a private network.

45. What do you understand by volume & snapshot in AWS 

In AWS, volume is block-level storage that we can assign to an EC2 instance. We can compare this to a hard disk from where the user can read or write the data. You pay for the data used by volumes as it is a way of measuring the storage section.

A snapshot is formed when we have a volume as it is a single point in time view of a volume. A snapshot is formed when the data stored in a volume is copied to another location at a single point in time.

46. If a failure during event processing via AWS Lambda occurs, how will it be handled?

If event processing via AWS Lambda is done in synchronous mode, then an exception will be displayed on the application used to call the function during failure. However, if an event is being processed in asynchronous mode, then a function will be called a minimum of three times in case of failure.

47. What do you know about Amazon WorkSpaces? 

Amazon WorkSpaces provides virtual and cloud-based desktops to work on, also known as workspaces. You do not need to deploy physical hardware and software by using Amazon WorkSpaces. You can install Microsoft Windows or Linux virtual desktops with the aid of Amazon WorkSpaces. Users can access virtual desktops via various devices or web browsers.

WorkSpaces allows users to choose from a wide range of available software/hardware configurations. It also provides a persistent desktop feature so that you can start working from where you had left off. Amazon also provides a WAM (WorkSpaces Application Manager) for deploying and managing applications on virtual desktops. 

48. What do you know about AWS IAM?

The key to cracking an AWS interview is to know about Amazon‚Äôs wide range of services. This question is a type of basic AWS interview question asked.

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) allows users to securely access AWS resources/services. One can create groups of users using AWS IAM and can assign them a customized set of permissions. Access to AWS resources can be allowed to any particular group/user via AWS IAM. One can access the IAM features under the ‚ÄòAWS Management Console‚Äô section of your AWS account.

49. Mention the differences between security groups and a network access control list.

AWS interview questions can be related to cloud access, security, customer service, and many more topics. One should practice AWS interview questions from diverse topics related to AWS services to crack the interview.

Security groups are used to control access to instances, while the network access control list is concerned with controlling access at the subnet level. Network access control lists can add rules for both ‚Äòallow‚Äô and ‚Äòdeny,‚Äô whereas security groups can add only rules for ‚Äòallow.‚Äô

AWS S3 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
50. What is AWS S3?

AWS‚Äôs cloud-based object storage service with unparalleled scalability, data availability, security, and performance is known as Amazon S3. On Amazon Web Services, the service can be used for online backup and archiving of data and applications (AWS).

51. Is Amazon S3 a global service?

Yes, Amazon S3 is a worldwide service. It offers object storage via a web interface and runs its global e-commerce network on Amazon‚Äôs scalable storage infrastructure.

52. How does AWS S3 work?

Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) is a service for storing objects. Amazon S3 enables users to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the internet.

53. What do you understand by ‚ÄòBucket‚Äô in AWS S3?

A bucket in AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) is a public object storage service such as file folders, which store objects containing data and descriptive metadata.

54. Why would you connect an instance to an S3 bucket?

You do not wish to connect an instance to an S3 bucket, as Block storage is not the same as object storage, which has serious consequences.

55. What do you understand by Versioning in S3?

S3 buckets support the feature of versioning. The bucket‚Äôs versioning is enabled globally. Versioning allows one to track various changes made to a file over time. If versioning is enabled, each uploaded file receives a unique Version ID. Consider a bucket that contains a file, and a user uploads a new modified copy of the same file to the bucket; both files had a unique Version ID and timestamps from when they were uploaded. So, if one needs to go back in time to an earlier state of the file, versioning makes it simple.
